Donor Narrative: Rendille Indigenous Knowledge & Research Empowerment Initiative – Ngurunit
The Rendille community of Ngurunit, Marsabit County, faces a rapid erosion of Indigenous Knowledge due to generational shifts, formal schooling, and changing pastoral livelihoods. Although this knowledge has guided pastoral resilience for centuries, there are currently no Rendille‑trained researchers to document and protect it. Existing studies rely almost entirely on monographs written by European researchers in the last century, leaving major gaps in understanding the community’s lived realities and cultural systems..docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) [project gr...anetti (2) | Word]
Building on eight months of ethnographic research conducted between February 2025 and January 2026, Be a Seedling—in partnership with local educators, elders, and Washington State University—is launching the first community‑engaged knowledge preservation initiative designed and led from within Ngurunit..docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true).docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) [project gr...anetti (2) | Word]
Project Purpose
The initiative aims to strengthen intergenerational knowledge transmission, build local research capacity, and create community‑owned digital archives that safeguard Rendille language, oral histories, ecological knowledge, and cultural practices. Elders, teachers, and adult students (18+) will collaboratively generate high‑quality cultural documentation that benefits both community identity and global understanding of pastoral resilience..docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true).docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) [project gr...anetti (2) | Word]
Approach & Activities
The project integrates Indigenous teaching, participatory research, and digital archiving through a structured 9‑month cycle (September 2026–May 2027). Key activities include:

Elder‑led cultural lessons delivered in the original Rendille language within the Ngurunit school..docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) [project gr...anetti (2) | Word]

Community Impact
Elders repeatedly emphasized that while drought and environmental shocks continue to challenge pastoral livelihoods, knowledge remains a source of resilience. This initiative directly responds to their call—“We cannot fight drought, but we can maintain our knowledge”—by embedding Indigenous expertise into schools, research processes, and digital spaces..docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true).docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) [project gr...anetti (2) | Word]
The project strengthens identity, supports language revitalization, creates opportunities for local leadership, and ensures that future generations inherit a documented, validated, and accessible record of their heritage.
